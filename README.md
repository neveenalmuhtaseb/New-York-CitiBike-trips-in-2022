# New-York-CitiBike-trips-in-2022

**Context**

For this project, we’ll be using public data from New York bike-sharing facilities operated by Citi
Bike. For context, Citi Bike’s popularity has increased since its launch in 2013. The company’s
marketing strategy promotes bike sharing as a sustainable and convenient means of
transportation, which has been very successful. Since the Covid–19 pandemic, New York
residents have found even more merit in bike sharing, creating higher demand. This has led to
distribution problems—such as fewer bikes at popular bike stations or stations full of docked
bikes, making it diﬃcult to return a hired bike—and customer complaints.

Our task is to diagnose where distribution issues stem from and advise
higher management on a solution based on your diagnosis of the root of the problem—whether
it’s sheer numbers, seasonal demand, or something else. Being in a management position also
makes you the bridge between divisions, which requires you to ensure the information is
tangible for the business development team. To effectively communicate your analysis to
non-analysts, you’ll present your insights in an interactive dashboard depicting the metrics you
identify as vital for tackling the distribution issues.

**Data and Tool Requirements**

For this project, you’ll use open source data from the [Citi Bike database for the year 2022](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). To
enrich this data set, you’ll gather weather data using [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov)’s API service. You will then use
Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to make charts; pandas and Kepler.gl,
to create maps; and Streamlit to design your final dashboard.
